	<p  class="init">	Characteristics of programming Languages, Factors influencing the evolution of
		programming language, developments in programming methodologies, desirable features and

		binding time.
	</p>

	<p> Data object variables, constants, data types,
		elementary data types, declaration, assignment and initialization, enumeration, characters,
		strings. Structured data type and objects: Specification of data structured types, vectors and
		arrays, records, variable size data structure, pointers and programmer constructed data structure,
		Sets files. Sub Program and programmer defined data types: Evolution of data types,
		abstractions, encapsulations, information hiding, sub programmes, abstract data types.
	</p>
	<p>
		Implicit and Explicit sequence control, sequence control with within
		expression and statements, recursive sub programmes, exception handling, co routines,
		Scheduled sub programmes, concurrent execution. Data control referencing environments, static
		and dynamic scope, local data local data referencing environment, shared data: Explicit common
		environment dynamic scope parameter passing mechanism
